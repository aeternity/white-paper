\begin{abstract}
The Aeternity blockchain aims to be a development platform for advanced blockchain applications that can be used by millions of users.
On the one hand the Aeternity blockchain is scalable due to a next generation
consensus algorithm and the use of state channels. On the other hand,
the Aeternity blockchain is a good development platform for
applications by offering native support for commonly used
\textbf{blockchain features}, as well as secure and higly efficient
contract language and virtual machine.

In this white paper we explain the above mentioned concepts of the
aeternity blockchain and highlight the design decisions. The
paper provides a high-level overview of the technology. For detailed
and specific implementation details we refer to the Aeternity protocol
description.
