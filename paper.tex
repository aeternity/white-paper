\begin{abstract}
The \blockchain\ aims to be a development platform for advanced blockchain
applications that can be used by millions of users.
On the one hand the \blockchain\ is scalable due to a next generation
consensus algorithm and the use of state channels. On the other hand,
the \blockchain\ is a excellent development platform for
applications by offering native support for commonly used
\textbf{blockchain features}, as well as secure and highly efficient
contract language and virtual machine.

In this white paper we explain the above mentioned concepts of the
\blockchain\ and highlight the design decisions. The
paper provides a high-level overview of the technology. For detailed
and specific implementation details we refer to the \aet\ protocol
description.
